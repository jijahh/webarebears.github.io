1. # Description
   - ## Research Question
      - ### Our project is an analysis on the current state of public education in the country. Particularly, this project aims to answer the question: Are there enough teachers to support the rate of growth of the number of students in public schools in the country? An additional question this paper hopes to answer is how the rate of teacher’s salaries relate to the amount of teachers employed in public schools. With this supporting research question we aim to find possible factors relating to teacher’s employment so that we may find possible solutions to the problem.
   - ## Background 
      - ### Education is one of the most essential needs of a human being. It is a widely recognized human right and one of the most important sustainable development goals. However, not everyone is able to enjoy access to education much less to a high quality one. Therefore it is in our best interest to look at some factors that may contribute to why this is and how we could go about beginning to solve this problem.
   - ## Hypotheses
      - ### For whether there are enough teachers to support the rate of growth of the number of students, we hypothesize that the rate of growth of teachers is statistically significantly slower than the rate of growth of students.
      - ### As for how the rate of change of teacher’s salaries relate to the amount of teachers employed, we hypothesize that there is a direct correlation between the rate of growth of the salaries of teachers and the amount of teachers employed.
2. # Data Set
   - ## Description
      - ### The first data set is the data containing the amount of teachers in the Philippines from 2016 up until 2021 in public schools. It is subdivided by what academic year the teachers taught in and it is further classified by what level education they teach (grade school, junior high, and senior high school) and what region they are located in. The second data set is the data containing the enrolment of students in the country. It includes students from private, public, and state universities and colleges (SUCs) and Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs), however for the purposes of this study we will primarily make use of the data set pertaining to public schools. The data is subdivided by the academic year the students were enrolled in, and further classified into the region the students are located in, their birth sex, their grade level, and in the case of senior high school students, their strand.
