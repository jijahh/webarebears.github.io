    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        <p>Are there enough teachers to handle the students in the country? Is the class size optimal for both teaching and learning?</p>
        <p>These are the questions to be answered by the project, which can be measured through the student to teacher ratio. By comparing this to the global averages, it determines how the Philippines will be <span class="bold-text">higher </span> (having larger class sizes) or <span class="bold-text">lower </span>(having lower class sizes). Moreover, this study also aims to seek <span class="bold-text">differences in ratios between the education levels</span> (Primary, Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary).</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div class ="background-header">“Our teachers are still overburdened with redundant clerical work that gets worse every day. Class sizes can reach as high as 50 to 55, and yet we expect our teachers to teach better.”</div>
    <div class ="background-sub"> A statement by Teachers’ Dignity Coalition chairman Benjo Basas <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/08/30/2292411/teachers-lament-worsening-education-system" target="_blank">(Mateo and Crisostomo, 2023)</a></div>

        <p>Despite the student’s access to education, the quality can be heavily influenced by the <span class="bold-text">ratio between students and teachers.</span></p>
        <p> A teacher with too many students is unable to properly tend to all of them, which affects the teachers’ well-being and the students’ learning and performance.  <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/pdf/conferences/research-congress-proceedings/2017/LLI/LLI-I-020.pdf" target="_blank"> A study by Mingoa (2017)</a> presents <span class="bold-text">oversized classes as one of the factors affecting teachers’ stress.</span> </p>

<div id="Data" class="section">
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        The datasets are obtained official datasets provided by <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/alternative-learning-system/resources/facts-and-figures/datasets/" target="_blank">DepEd (Local Source)</a>  and <a href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/#" target="_blank">UNESCO UIS (Global Source).</a>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> DepEd Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>There are two datasets provided by DepEd which are necessary for the study: number of teachers by school year and enrollment data by school year. The amount of teachers are sub grouped by region and by the level of education they teach: <span class="bold-text">Elementary, Junior High School, and Senior High School</span>. Enrollment data on the other hand, are grouped by region, birth sex, and grade level.</p>
        <p>Due to the scope of the study, the enrollment data only focuses on public school students, as the DepEd can only disclose the amount of public school teachers.
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> UNESCO UIS Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>The UNESCO UIS Data also presents both number of teachers by year and enrollment data per year. Each data is grouped by country, and can be classified further into the continent they belong. By the definition of their data, the levels of education are classified by <span class="bold-text">Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> Preprocessing of Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p> Before combining the two major datasets, it was necessary to set a definition that Primary (Elementary), Lower Secondary (Junior High School), and Upper Secondary (Senior High School) for brevity.</p>
        <p> For the scope of the school years, the team selected 2017 to 2021. This is the latest data presented by DepEd and the earliest year where the Philippines implemented Senior High School (S.Y. 2016-2017).</p>
        <p> To obtain the averages, most of the data were summed up by school year and divide the number of enrollees over the number of teachers. For the UNESCO UIS dataset, this was done individually for each country. However, due to the large size of this dataset some countries were removed due to inconsistency, that is when the data for the country's enrollment is present but the number of teachers is not, and vice versa. </p>

    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>Primary Research Question</p>
        <p>The graph shows that the student-teacher ratio of the Philippines is higher than the global average. This means that the Philippines holds a larger average class size for one teacher.</p>

        <p>Secondary Research Question</p>
        <p>This graph shows the variations of the student-teacher ratio across the levels of education. Despite the low global average of Upper Secondary education, the Philippine's ratio for the education level is extremely high.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <div class="res-title">Methods</div>

    <img src="media/results.png" alt="results">
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>For the first research question, to analyze the data in accordance with our hypothesis, we used an independent samples t-test comparing the data from the Philippines with the Global Averages. To obtain the Global Averages, we combined the data from all levels from 2017-2021. We used an independent samples t-test since the values for the global averages are not yet known and there was no formal sampling done when getting the Philippines' data. After the analysis, we obtained a T value of 3.852 with a p value of 0.000121, therefore we reject the null hypothesis with a 95% confidence level, indicating a statistically significant difference between the the Philippines' ratio and the global averages. In fact, the Philippines has a much higher ratio than the global averages, meaning there is statistically significantly more students per teacher in the Philippines than the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>As for the second research question we again used an independent samples t-test. For this research question, we wanted to find the difference between the Philippines ratios vs the Global averages among the different levels: Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary. To do this, we did an independent samples t-test per level, that is, comparing the Philippines' primary level data with the global primary data, and so on. </p>
        <p>For the results, we made an interesting discovery. We found that there is a statistically significant difference for two out of the three levels, namely for the lower and upper secondary levels. For the primary level however, we found no statistically significant difference. For the primary level, we obtained a T value of 0.705 and a p-value of 0.4808, meaning we must accept the null hypothesis, that is, there is no statistically significant difference betweenn the Philippines' primary level ratios and the global primary level ratios at a 95% confidence level. For the lower secondary level, we obtained a T-value of 2.282, and a low p-value of 0.023, indicating a statistically significant difference between the Philippines' lower secondary level ratios and the global secondary level ratios at a 95% confidence level. For the upper secondary level, we obtained a T-value of 6.700 and a shockingly low p-value of 6.18x10<sup>-11</sup>, indicating an extremely strong difference between the Philippines' upper secondary level ratios and the global upper secondary level ratios.</p>

        <p>I am a 3rd year standing BS Computer Science student from UP Diliman. I am still not sure why I decided to pursue this course and have no idea when I will be able to graduate. I just thought using computers is cool and that I will learn how to hack facebook accounts.</p>
        <p>I have many hobbies, including reading mangas, playing video games, playing instruments, and spending time with friends. However, I waste most of my time watching reels instead of doing things I should be doing. Thank you very much!</p>

        <p>Hello, I'm John and I am currently a computer science student at the University of the Philippines Diliman. I've personally been part of 40+ student classes so I'm glad to have the opportunity to dig deeper about this topic using the math and programming skills I have honed throughout my studies.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast to the heavy math and programming in my course, I have a deep passion for art, both digital and traditional. I also love getting into the details and analyzing all forms of art, especially movies, music, and other forms of media.</p>
