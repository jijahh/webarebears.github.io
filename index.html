    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        <p>Are there enough teachers to handle the students in the country? Is the class size optimal for both teaching and learning?</p>
        <p>These are the questions to be answered by the project, which can be measured through the student to teacher ratio. By comparing this to the global averages, it determines how the Philippines will be <span class="bold-text">higher </span> (having larger class sizes) or <span class="bold-text">lower </span>(having lower class sizes). Moreover, this study also aims to seek <span class="bold-text">differences in ratios between the education levels</span> (Primary, Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary).</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <div class ="background-header">“Our teachers are still overburdened with redundant clerical work that gets worse every day. Class sizes can reach as high as 50 to 55, and yet we expect our teachers to teach better.”</div>
    <div class ="background-sub"> A statement by Teachers’ Dignity Coalition chairman Benjo Basas <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/08/30/2292411/teachers-lament-worsening-education-system" target="_blank">(Mateo and Crisostomo, 2023)</a></div>
    <div class = "background-body"> 
        <p>Despite the student’s access to education, the quality can be heavily influenced by the <span class="bold-text">ratio between students and teachers.</span></p>
        <p> A teacher with too many students is unable to properly tend to all of them, which affects the teachers’ well-being and the students’ learning and performance.  <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/pdf/conferences/research-congress-proceedings/2017/LLI/LLI-I-020.pdf" target="_blank"> A study by Mingoa (2017)</a> presents <span class="bold-text">oversized classes as one of the factors affecting teachers’ stress.</span> </p>
        <p> Another study by  <a href="https://journal.uin-alauddin.ac.id/index.php/Eternal/article/view/20876" target="_blank"> Galang et al. (2021)</a> identifies that <span class="bold-text">smaller student-teacher ratios among Asian countries yield better academic results,</span> measured by Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores. </p>
        <p> As such, this project aims to find insights on how the ratio of the Philippines compares with the rest of the world.</p>

<div id="Data" class="section">
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        The datasets are obtained official datasets provided by <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/alternative-learning-system/resources/facts-and-figures/datasets/" target="_blank">DepEd (Local Source)</a>  and <a href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/#" target="_blank">UNESCO UIS (Global Source).</a>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> DepEd Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>There are two datasets provided by DepEd which are necessary for the study: number of teachers by school year and enrollment data by school year. The amount of teachers are sub grouped by region and by the level of education they teach: <span class="bold-text">Elementary, Junior High School, and Senior High School</span>. Enrollment data on the other hand, are grouped by region, birth sex, and grade level.</p>
        <p>Due to the scope of the study, the enrollment data only focuses on public school students, as the DepEd can only disclose the amount of public school teachers.
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> UNESCO UIS Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>The UNESCO UIS Data also presents both number of teachers by year and enrollment data per year. Each data is grouped by country, and can be classified further into the continent they belong. By the definition of their data, the levels of education are classified by <span class="bold-text">Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"> Preprocessing of Data</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p> Before combining the two major datasets, it was necessary to set a definition that Primary (Elementary), Lower Secondary (Junior High School), and Upper Secondary (Senior High School) for brevity.</p>
        <p> For the scope of the school years, the team selected 2017 to 2021. This is the latest data presented by DepEd and the earliest year where the Philippines implemented Senior High School (S.Y. 2016-2017).</p>
        <p> To obtain the averages, most of the data were summed up by school year and divide the number of enrollees over the number of teachers. For the UNESCO UIS dataset, this was done individually for each country. However, due to the large size of this dataset some countries were removed due to inconsistency, that is when the data for the country's enrollment is present but the number of teachers is not, and vice versa. </p>
