    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>In the Philippines, only 34.3% of the population aged 5 years and older had reached or completed at most high school or secondary level, 27.4% had reached or completed at most elementary level, and 28.6% had reached or completed at most college level. 
            Clearly, there is an education problem in the country.
        </p>

        <div class="background-sub">Based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing. <a href="https://rssocar.psa.gov.ph/education/node/1684057427" target="_blank">(Philippine Statistics Authority, 2024)</a></div>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        <p>This specific issue is extremely relevant to us as students funded by the country, and therefore we wanted to identify the root of the problem. One of the factors we aim to focus on in this study is how the number of teachers relate to the number of students</p>
        <p>Specifically:</p>
        <p>Are there enough teachers to handle the students in the country? Is the class size optimal for both teaching and learning?</p>
        <p>These are the questions this project aims to answer, which can be measured through the student to teacher ratio. By comparing this to the global averages, it determines how the Philippines will be <span class="bold-text">higher </span> (having larger class sizes) or <span class="bold-text">lower </span>(having lower class sizes). Moreover, this study also aims to seek <span class="bold-text">differences in ratios between the education levels</span> (Primary, Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary).</p>

        Is the student-teacher ratio in the Philippines <span class="blue-text">significantly higher</span> than the global average?

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <div class="res-title"><i>Let's talk about the data we used,</i></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class ="sectionbody">
        The datasets are obtained official datasets provided by <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/alternative-learning-system/resources/facts-and-figures/datasets/" target="_blank">DepEd (Local Source)</a>  and <a href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/#" target="_blank">UNESCO UIS (Global Source).</a>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"><span class="brown-text">DepEd Data</span></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>There are two datasets provided by DepEd which are necessary for the study: number of teachers by school year and enrollment data by school year. The amount of teachers are sub grouped by region and by the level of education they teach: <span class="bold-text">Elementary, Junior High School, and Senior High School</span>. Enrollment data on the other hand, are grouped by region, birth sex, and grade level.</p>
        <p>Due to the scope of the study, the enrollment data only focuses on public school students, as the DepEd can only disclose the amount of public school teachers.
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"><span class="brown-text">UNESCO UIS Data</span></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>The UNESCO UIS Data also presents both number of teachers by year and enrollment data per year. Each data is grouped by country, and can be classified further into the continent they belong. By the definition of their data, the levels of education are classified by <span class="bold-text">Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"><i>But we can't use the data as is, since data is never clean from the source. We have to handle, organize, and fix the data so we can make use of them for our purposes. This is how we did it:</i></div>
    <div class="res-title"><span class="brown-text">Preprocessing of Data</span></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p> Before combining the two major datasets, it was necessary to set a definition that Primary (Elementary), Lower Secondary (Junior High School), and Upper Secondary (Senior High School) for brevity.</p>
        <p> For the scope of the school years, the team selected 2017 to 2021. This is the latest data presented by DepEd and the earliest year where the Philippines implemented Senior High School (S.Y. 2016-2017).</p>
        <p> To obtain the averages, most of the data were summed up by school year and divide the number of enrollees over the number of teachers. For the UNESCO UIS dataset, this was done individually for each country. However, due to the large size of this dataset some countries were removed due to inconsistency, that is when the data for the country's enrollment is present but the number of teachers is not, and vice versa. </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p><span class="green-text">Primary Research Question</span></p>
        <p>To analyze the data in accordance with our hypothesis, we used an <span class="bold-text">independent samples t-test </span>comparing the data from the Philippines with the Global Averages. To obtain the Global Averages, we combined the data from all levels from 2017-2021. This test is used since the values for the global averages are not yet known and there was no formal sampling done obtaining getting the local data. After the analysis, we obtained a <span class="bold-text"> T value of 3.852 with a p value of 0.000121, therefore we reject the null hypothesis </span>with a 95% confidence level, indicating a statistically significant difference between the the Philippines' ratio and the global averages. In fact, the Philippines has a much higher ratio than the global averages, meaning there is statistically significantly more students per teacher in the Philippines than the rest of the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="green-text">Secondary Research Question</span></p>
        <p>The independent samples t-test is once used for the secondary research question. Now, we want to find the difference between the Philippines ratios vs the Global averages among the different levels: Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary. Thus, independent samples t-test was conducted per level, that is, comparing the Philippines' primary level data with the global primary data, and so on. For the results, <span class="bold-text">there is a statistically significant difference for two out of the three levels,</span> namely for the lower and upper secondary levels. </p>
        <p> For the <span class = "blue-text">primary level</span>, we found no statistically significant difference. A <span class="bold-text"> T-value of 0.705 and a p-value of 0.4808 was obtained, meaning we must accept the null hypothesis, that is, there is no statistically significant difference</span> betweenn the Philippines' primary level ratios and the global primary level ratios at a 95% confidence level. </p>
        <p> For the <span class = "blue-text">lower secondary level</span>, we obtained a <span class="bold-text"> T-value of 2.282, and a low p-value of 0.023, indicating a statistically significant difference </span> between the Philippines' lower secondary level ratios and the global secondary level ratios at a 95% confidence level.</p>
        <p> For the <span class = "blue-text">upper secondary level</span>, we obtained a <span class="bold-text"> T-value of 6.700 and a shockingly low p-value of 6.18x10<sup>-11</sup>, indicating an strong difference </span> between the Philippines' upper secondary level ratios and the global upper secondary level ratios.

<div id="Conclusions" class="section">
    <h3>Discussions</h3>
    <div class="res-title"><span class="brown-text">Interpretations</span></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>With the T-test results and acceptance/rejection of the hypotheses, we obtain insight for the different research questions. For the primary research question, it can be seen that the average student-teacher ratio (of all levels) of the Philippines is significantly higher compared to the global average. In other words, classrooms in the Philippines are more likely to feature a large number of students in a single section or class.</p>
        <p>As for the secondary research questions, we can see that the same can be said for the lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education, with the upper-secondary ratio showing a more concerning difference hinted by it having the highest T-value and lowest p-value. Among the three levels of education, only the primary level bears no significant difference when compared to its global average counterpart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"><span class="brown-text">Implications</span></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>With this information, we can imply that teachers in the Philippines are stretched thinly with more students to juggle which affects their ability to cater to all of their students’ individual needs and, equally important, their own needs and well-being.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title"><i>But we recognize that our research is not perfect, therefore we recommend the following to future researchers:</i></div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p><span class="blue-text">Missing data </span>– In certain “year” categories, some countries had no data/missing data. To overcome this the research instead focused on continental averages instead of averages per country.</p>
        <p><span class="blue-text">Formatting consistency </span>– With the mentioned missing data, in order to crunch all the numbers, new data sets were formed to handle missing values and to make the coding process easier.</p>
        <p><span class="blue-text">Dealing with outliers </span>– Given the nature of the research topic/question, there are little to no outliers (since this topic covers ratios and averages of large samples instead of individual samples) so “outliers”, if any, were left as is.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="res-title">In conclusion,</div>
    <div class="sectionbody">
        <p>Teachers in the Philippines, except for primary-level teachers, handle more students than normal. This greatly adds challenge to an already difficult job as they would have to manage larger records, guide more pupils, check more tests, etc… The added workload can potentially negatively affect the teacher’s well-being, and if a teacher cannot teach properly, students cannot learn properly.</p>
